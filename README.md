This is the first foundational project during Revature training.
The purpose of the project is to build a program to reduce the manual work for managing Car Models, Car Sales, Car Details, Car Search etc. through databases.
Modules present:
1. Admin
2. User
There are 4 tables:
1. Car_details (details of the cars still available).
2. User details. (Users who have registered.)
3. Orders (User can order , the details re stored here.)
4. Sales (The orders which are sold).

The user can see the present stock of the cars, and order the cars he/she wants to buy.
The admin can do all the modifications to the tables, except the user table.
The admin can delete and update only the car_details's records. All the deletion and updation will be done automitacally as per the admin's actions.

Main file:
Carserv.java

Rest 2 files of the 2 modules Admin and User are Admin.java and User.java respectively.

Junit testing file:
